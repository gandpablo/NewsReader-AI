'China has been robbing us blind for decades,' Trump declared to roaring applause. 'And the Biden administration is letting it happen. Not on my watch!'\n",
    "\n",
    "Trump blamed China for manipulating global markets, stealing U.S. technology, flooding America with cheap goods, and, once again, for unleashing COVID-19 on the world. He also accused American elites of selling out the country to Beijing in exchange for profits and influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "'We need to take our country back from the globalists, the socialists, and the China-first politicians,' he said. 'America First is not just a slogan — it’s a mission. We are done being weak, we are done being controlled.'\n",
    "\n",
    "The former president called for 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, a total decoupling of U.S. supply chains from China, and massive investment in American manufacturing and energy independence. He also proposed banning Chinese companies from purchasing American farmland, universities, and media outlets.\n",
    "\n",
    "'We will not be a colony of China,' Trump thundered. 'We will dominate economically, militarily, and spiritually — because we are Americans, and we bow to no one.'\n",
    "\n",
    "The crowd responded with chants of 'USA! USA!' and 'Trump 2024', as flags waved and merchandise flew off tables. Conservative commentators praised the speech as a 'rallying cry for national sovereignty', while left-leaning outlets dismissed it as xenophobic and incendiary.\n",
