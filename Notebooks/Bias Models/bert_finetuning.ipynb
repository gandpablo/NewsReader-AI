office has provided the following statement to entity emphasis mine and spokesman entity reaffirmed the governor s categorical denial of mayor entity s allegations in a subsequent phone call entity is a partisan network that has been openly hostile to governor entity and almost gleeful in their efforts attacking him even taking the unprecedented step of producing and airing a nearly three minute attack ad against him this week governor entity and his entire administration have been helping entity get the help they need after entity with the city already having been approved for nearly million dollars in federal aid and is targeted to get even more when entity approves the next rounds of funding the governor and mayor entity have had a productive relationship with mayor entity even recently saying she is very glad he is been our governor it is very clear partisan politics are at play here as democratic mayors with a political axe to grind come out of the woodwork and try to get their faces on television update hmmm a entity reporter notes that entity peddled a similar story but with different details to him eight days ago days ago entity mayor told entity her loss of entity aid was tied to failure to endorse govchristie now different story entity mattkatz so last week entity was withholding entity funding in retaliation for her lack of endorsement now she says it was all about a development deal that is a suspicious evolution also what she is alleging is outright corruption why did not she go to authorities at the time instead of very belatedly leaking to sympathetic reporters finally entity reported that entity has only received about in relief aid entity statement says the city s been approved for more than million with more to come why the massive discrepancy recommended the democratic mayor of entity entity has leveled new allegations against entity administration accusing top officials of withholding needed entity relief funds from her city because she would not sign off on an unrelated urban development deal favored by the governor mayor entity made the explosive claims in an entity appearance this morning two senior members of gov entity s administration warned a entity mayor earlier this year that her town would be starved of hurricane relief money unless she approved a lucrative redevelopment plan favored by the governor according to the mayor and emails and personal notes she shared with entity the mayor entity has not approved the project but she did request million in hurricane relief for her city of entity of which was underwater after entity hit in october what she got was to defray the cost of a single back up generator plus an additional in recovery grants in an exclusive interview entity broke her silence and named lt gov entity and entity entity community affairs commissioner as the two officials who delivered messages on behalf of a governor she had long supported zimmer says entity made the quid pro quo explicit in private conversations in may of seven months after the storm ravaged much of the entity coast on may entity and entity met at the hoboken shoprite that is where entity said entity delivered the first message about the relief aide zimmer shared this diary entry which she said she wrote later that day at the end of a big tour of entity and meeting she pulls me aside with no one else around and says that i need to move forward with the entity project it is very important to the governor the word is that you are against it and you need to move forward or we are not going to be able to help you i know it is not right these things should not be connected but they are she says and if you tell anyone i will deny it the second warning according to zimmer came four days later she and entity who now led entity department of community affairs were seated together on stage for a for a entity public television special on entity again entity provided this diary entry from may which she said captured the incident we are mic ed up with other panelists all around us and probably the sound team is listening and he says i hear you are against the entity project i reply i am not against the entity project in fact i want more commercial development in entity oh really everyone in the state entity believes you are against it the buzz is that you are against it if you move that forward the money would start flowing to you he tells me there are reasons to be skeptical of her account if entity running mate and second in command truly issued these threats last spring apparently with some degree of guilt and contrition why are we just hearing about them now why did not zimmer a democrat who says she supported entity but who declined to endorse him immediately blow the whistle on this outrageous conduct if the governor s office was playing such cynical and callous politics with entity funds the people of entity had a right to know prior to the election beyond the election timing why did zimmer wait to go public until there was political blood in the water with her fellow democrats and the media in a feeding frenzy over the bridge story also how does entity explain her series of tweets and statements lavishly praising entity post sandy leadership and thanking him for all of his assistance for entity entity office entity tweeted the following sentiments in august to be clear i am very glad governor entity has been our gov i am not endorsing because of hob s non partisan mayoral race entity dawnzimmernj jennaportnoy govchristie he has done a great job for entity we have a non partisan mayoral election on nov th entity dawnzimmernj why would she voice such strong support a great job for entity for a man whose administration had supposedly targeted her with an appalling shakedown scheme just four months prior would not she be trying to derail the candidacy of an imperious and corrupt governor on behalf of the people he was unjustly punishing i will leave you with a few thoughts i am unwilling to assail or defend entity on this story until additional facts are in so far it is entity s word against the entity each side has some circumstantial evidence backing their version of events none of which is conclusive if entity really did what zimmer alleges it a disgrace if she is exaggerating or fabricating the story that is equally disgraceful if mr entity laid out the alleged back scratching calculus on a television stage filled with cameras microphones and other guests surely some additional corroboration of entity s account must exist let us see it was entity s share of the relief aid disproportionately small compared to similarly afflicted cities entity hypes the fact that entity requested more than million in assistance but only received less than half a million that is an interesting data point but it may not be the whole story which was more fishy entity s request or the amount of help her city has received it should be fairly easy to determine whether entity was hung out to dry on relief funds christie angrily accused his fellow republicans of playing politics with relief funds when several entity conservatives sought to strip the relief bill of unrelated pork if he himself then turned around and wielded the money as a political hammer it will look even worse entity has already gotten egg on its face over
